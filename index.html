Accessibility

![A Nutshell](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/37626989/nutshell.jpg)_Core Ideas:_

Everyone needs to be able to access it,

Else it's not going on the website.

This includes:

Blind People.

Deaf People.

People with old computers.

People without _desktop_ computers

People with dial up.

People with motor issues.

This is not hard...

If you don't leave it to the end.

We don't bite, we want to help you be able to do this.

That being said we arn't going to do it for you.

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37626989/maxresdefault.jpg)ain't nobody got time for that

Usually this is your consultant's responsibility.

Patrick put it into the contract boilerplate. 

_Think web first._

We are supposed to be GreenDOT.

![wasteful paper](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/37626989/waste%20paper%20real.jpg)_Do you like wasteing paper?_

Didn't think so.

How To:

Add alt text to images as you make them.

Your software supports this.

Trust me it does.

Alt text serves in place of an image.

_Bad:_

A map showing cities by size in MA.

_Good:_

Boston is the biggest city in MA.

You can also tag images as background.

Scanned PDFs are a no-no.

_Excuses:_

Letters physically mailed to us.

Documents that predate the digital era.

_Not Excuses:_

Documents your boss signed.

Documents that MassDEP sent you.

_Other Tips:_

Always export to PDF or save as PDF _NEVER PRINT TO PDF!_

Keep it under 4MB.

(If possible.)

If it's not a report appendix is almost always possible.

_speaking of complex reports_

instead of one giant unwieldy pdf

you can give me a folder of pdfs

labled 1-cover, 2-1-toc, 2-2-table of figures, etc

and when in doubt you can get me the non-pdf version

_Excel_

If you can't sort it, it's not accessible.

It also needs to make sense if you:

turn off all the styles,

unsplit all the cells,

and view a row out of context.

_How I do an Excel Spreadsheet_

Save as CSV

Close Excel

Open CSV in Excel

(yes we are reopening excel)

Adjust Columns Widths and Save As PDF

Or Just Post the Raw Data 

Seriously _A CSV is More Accessable then a PDF_

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37626989/opendata.png)_If you don't believe me ask The White House_

_Power Point_

It's not for maps.

It's not for posters.

If it's not a presentation, your using it wrong.

Also your template needs to be accessible too.

Make sure your (alt tagged) graphics are sensibly sized.

_Other_

That poster the architect showed at your meeting?

Don't bother mucking around in Acrobat.

We can put the alt text on the web page next to the link to the image.

_File Names_

"report aproved updated 08041946 FINAL.pdf" is fine for you to use as a title

(well actually it shows we need version control software)

but I degress

For posting:

No spaces, it can break links

use CamelCase, snake_case, or spinal-case

remove your book keeping notation e.g. "_aproved_", "_final_", _the date_, etc.

_Tips:_

Keep it simple.

The visual flourishes, not the content are often the problem.

Make it right first, then make it pretty.

Touch base with us _before_ you start making it.

"_I need the report I spent 8 months on made accessible and posted COB today._" Will not endear you to us.

It's hard/impossible to fix a document already PDFed.

If I'm going to help you I need the original.

Which means _you_ need the original from your consultant. 

If your exporting to PDF and then bringing those PDFs into a document you plan on making into a PDF,

stop and come talk to me.

There are options besides PDF

A report can be made as HTML

As in written with the intent of it being posted as a web page

AKA written for the medium that 99% of people who aren't in this building will read it on

_Open Data_

Has anyone ever sent you a PDF of a spread sheet instead of the spread sheet?

Do you remember how angry you were?

This is how the public feels when we post a PDF of a data table.

A CSV or JSON file is accessable _with no extra work_

They are _Machine Readable_

aka usefull for researchers/developers

which means reports, apps and mashups

which means good publicity

for us doing _less_ work

sure it dosn't look as nice but,

_no one ever filed a federal civil rights lawsuit because a report was ugly_
